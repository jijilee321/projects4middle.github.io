      <p> As a kid, I hated math. I didn't see much of point of why I was learning math or when I would ever need math. To be honest, the only reason why I chose math as one of my core subject to be licensed was simply because I was good at it. BUT, after I have learned of wasy in which I can have fun with math, my belief has changed. It fueled my passion of showing my future students to see the joy in math. I have created some projects that middle school students can play with math as they are engaged in a real-life scenario. I hope this helps your students to find the joy I have found. </p>
